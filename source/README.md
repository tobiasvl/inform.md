# Source web

The Lua files in this repository are written as literate [Inweb](https://ganelson.github.io/inweb/inweb/) programs, or "webs". They're generated by the files in this directory, which also serve as the documentation.

To use the files in this directory, you will need to install [inweb](https://github.com/ganelson/inweb) first.

## Tangling

To build the Lua files ("tangle" the web):
```
inweb tangle inform7.inweb -to ../inform7.lua
```

## Weaving

First, we will need to tell Inweb how Lua syntax looks. Symlink or copy the `Languages/` directory inside `Materials/` in your Inweb installation, for example like this:

```
~/src/inform.md/source$ ln -s $PWD/Languages/ ~/work/inweb/Materials/Languages
```

Then, to build the documentation ("weave" the web):
```
inweb weave
```
